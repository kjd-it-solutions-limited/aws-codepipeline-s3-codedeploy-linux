            Contracted to Analyise their MTP Procedures ad methodology.<br/>
            Upon arrival it was  made clear that most of the purchasing and stock control were completed via Excel sheets,<br/>
            A full MRP application had been purchased but was not configured  or live.<br />
            The servers were on  Redhat and the Database was MFGPRO. The requirement was to implement the system<br />
            to live with a deadline of 18 months.<br />
            We initially analysed  the existing procedure from each department,<br />
            from there We could produce guidelines and then produced full training plans to all levels of the company, </p>
            We purchased external  software to enable speedy export/import of data from Excel to MFGPRO,</p>
            We rewrote the  Disaster recovery process and also incorporated additional offsite resource<br />
            for full system recovery and was able to automate the processes as much as possible via bash scripting.<br />
            Because of steps that we implemented the fail over process was reduced from 60 minutes to 15 minutes.<br />
            The system went live in an unprecedented 12 months.</p>

<strong>Schlumberger:  Project Support Analyst</strong><br />
            Contracted to advise and implement an upgrade to their RHEL Workstations<br/>
            The company had a project to upgrade one of the Applications use on the many Linux Workstations,<br />
            however initial tests had shown that the upgrade would not work on the existing version of Redhat,<br />
            and there was now a requirement to upgrade all Linux workstations. <br />
            There were 186 workstations that were spread across four buildings on several floors.<br />
            Single sign on was implemented would mean that Active Directory would also be affected<br />
            Due to the variations in workstation configuration, including dual boot, several kick-start <br />
            configurations were produced.<br />
            Also a bash script ran from CDROM in would install the upgrade and assist with the Active Directory<br />
            modifications.<br />
            Due to the upgrade  plan, We reduced the rollout from 14 days to 3.5 days, resulting in a<br />
            decrease in the  outage time by 75%</p>

<strong>Nanopore:  IT Systems Administrator</strong><br />
            Contracted to provide Advice and support to the Linux Virtual estate.<br/>
            Due to the nature of DNA processing it had been a problem whereby the existing SGE Pipeline cluster<br />
            was not adequate for processing all the data, this created a huge backlog, <br />
            Resulting in missed deadlines for development.</p>
            One of our tasks was to rectify the backlog situation within a two week period.<br />
            We increased the cluster with an additional 8 blades, <br />
            This was completed within 48 hours and succeeded in reducing the backlog over the following 48 hours,<br />
            enabling the next phase of development to be rolled out in time for a planned international conference.</p>
            Advising with regards to the setting up an automated configuration infrastructure using Ansible and Eucalyptus to replace the existing AWS supplier.</p>

<strong>National  Trust: Support Specialist</strong><br />
            Contracted to provide Advice and support to the Linux estate.<br/>
            Donations are critical to how the Charity is funded, part of the DSS PCI requirements is to<br />
            ensure the financial details of customers and beneficiaries are kept secure.<br />
            A requirement was made so that the Financial Database should have its password changed every 6 weeks.<br />
            This would also affect all connecting applications. <br />
            Initially the process would require an extended outage of all the financial systems.<br />
            We wrote bash scripts that would push out the new password to any relating applications and scripts via a text file.</p>
            We also created a procedure to ensure this was as efficient as possible enabling anyone with <br />
            the relevant level of access to complete.</p>
            By implementing my  changes the outage was reduced from 24 hours to just 2 hours,<br />
            which in turn created greater financial benefits to the company.</p>

<strong>1E:  Test Analyst</strong><br />
            Contracted to create Linux and Unix Test scripts<br/>
            1E are a &lsquo;Green&rsquo;  software company, producing software that aids companies to help reduce their footprint<br />
            by ensuring servers use minimal power, and then increased power when required.<br />
            Their software also reports all information relevant to the infrastructure.<br />
            Upon arrival it was clear that the software worked solely for Microsoft Servers.<br />
            And that a new requirement was made for this to work on all operating systems.<br />
            We produced a single bash script which checked the O/S (Linux or Unix), and what type/version.<br />
            It collected all the relevant information according to the O/S, such as CPU and Memory Usage<br />
            enabling the software to work. <br />
            The company could then offer the software for all operating systems to both existing and new customers.</p>

<strong>GE  Aviation: Project Manager</strong><br />
            Contracted to manage and implement a software licensing project and previously to complete a<br />
            migration of Documentation as part of a company sell-off.<br/>
            The requirement was to provide validation of software licences installed on the test infrastructure.<br />
            Appointed to manage the  Software Project, our task was to find a method to retrieve a list of installed<br />
            software from every Test Rig.<br />
            This ranged from the very old Dos 3.0  servers to Microsoft 2008 Servers, as well as Linux and Unix servers.</p>
            We produced a script to run on all variants of Microsoft operating systems to provide a listing<br />
            to import into a new MS SQL database.<br />
            This database was then compared to the Purchase order database for the relevant licenses.<br />
            With this information; We were able to show the shortfall to be in the region of &pound;425,000, <br />
            which enabled the company to prevent any future fines.<br />
