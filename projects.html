            The company had a project to upgrade one of the applications on many Linux Workstations,<br />

            In place were 186 workstations spread across four buildings on several floors.<br />
            Single sign on was implemented meaning that Active Directory would also be affected<br />
            Due to the variations in workstation configuration, including dual boot, several kick-start configurations were produced.<br />
            Also a bash script ran from CDROM in would install the upgrade and assist with the Active Directory modifications.<br />

<strong>Nanopore:  IT Systems Administrator</strong><br />
            Contracted to provide Advice and consultancy for the Linux Virtual estate.<br/>

            To rectify the backlog situation within a two week period, We increased the cluster with an additional 8 blades. <br />
            Completed in less than 48 hours; this succeeded in reducing the backlog over the following 48 hours,<br />
            Enabling the next phase of development to be rolled out in time for a planned international conference.</p>

<strong>National  Trust: Support Specialist</strong><br />

            A requirement was made so that the Financial Database should have its password changed every 6 weeks as part of DSS PCI<br />
            This would also affect all connecting applications. <br />
            Initially the process would require an extended outage of all the financial systems of several days.<br />
            We wrote bash scripts that would push out the new password to any relating applications and scripts via a text file.</p>
            We also created a procedure to ensure this was as efficient as possible enabling anyone with the relevant level of access to complete.</p>
            By implementing our changes; We succesfully reduced the downtime from 24 hours to just 2 hours, <br />
            This enabled payments to be accepted much sooner, which in turn created greater financial benefits to the National Trust.</p>

            We produced a single bash script which checked the O/S (Linux or Unix), and what type/version.<br />
            It collected all the relevant information according to the O/S, such as CPU and Memory Usage enabling the software to work. <br />
            1E could then offer the software to both existing and new customers for all operating systems.</p>

            Appointed to manage the  Software Project, our task was to find a method to retrieve a list of installed software from every Test Rig.<br />
            This ranged from the very old Dos 3.0  servers to Microsoft 2008 Servers, as well as Linux and Unix servers.</p>
            We produced a script to run on all variants of Microsoft operating systems to provide a listing to import into a new MS SQL database.<br />
            This was then compared to the Purchase orders.<br />
            With this information; We were able to show the shortfall to be in the region of &pound;425,000.<br />
            This enabled GE Aviation to reduce or prevent any future fines.<br />
