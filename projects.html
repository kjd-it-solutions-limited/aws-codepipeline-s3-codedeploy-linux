                                      Upon arrival it was  made clear that most of the purchasing and stock control were completed via  Excel sheets, A full MRP application had been purchased but was not configured  or live.<br />
                                      The servers were on  Redhat and the Database was MFGPRO. The requirement was to implement the system  to live with a deadline of 18 months.<br />
                                      I initially analysed  the existing procedure from each department, from there I could produce  guidelines and then produced full training plans to all levels of the company, </p>
                                    <p>I purchased external  software to enable speedy export/import of data from Excel to MFGPRO,</p>

                                      Because of steps that  I implemented the fail over process was reduced from 60 minutes to 15 minutes. The  system went live in an unprecedented 12 months.</p>

  <strong>Schlumberger:  Project Support Analyst</strong><br />
                                      The company had a  project to upgrade one of the Applications use on the many Linux Workstations,  however initial tests had shown that the upgrade would not work on the existing  version of Redhat, and there was now a requirement to upgrade all Linux  workstations. <br />
  &nbsp;There were 186 workstations that were spread  across four buildings on several floors. <br />
                                      Single sign on was  implemented would mean that Active Directory would also be affected<br />
                                      Due to the variations  in workstation configuration, including dual boot, several kick-start  configurations were produced. Also a bash script ran from CDROM in would  install the upgrade and assist with the Active Directory modifications.<br />
                                      Due to the upgrade  plan, I reduced the rollout from 14 days to 3.5 days, resulting in a<br />
                                      decrease in the  outage time by 75%</p>

                                      <strong>Nanopore:  IT Systems Administrator</strong><br />
                                      Due to the nature of  DNA processing it had been a problem whereby the existing SGE Pipeline cluster  was not adequate for processing all the data, this created a huge backlog, <br />
                                      Resulting in missed  deadlines for development.</p>
                                    <p>Appointed as the  Linux system administrator one of my tasks was to rectify the backlog situation  within a two week period. I increased the cluster with an additional 8 blades, <br />
                                      This was completed  within 48 hours.. <br />
                                      This succeeded in  reducing the backlog over the following 48 hours, enabling the next phase of  development to be rolled out in time for a planned international conference.</p>
                                    <p>Advising with regards  to the setting up an automated configuration infrastructure using Ansible and  Eucalyptus to replace the existing AWS supplier.</p>

                                      <strong>National  Trust: Support Specialist</strong><br />
                                      Donations are  critical to how the Charity is funded, part of the DSS PCI requirements is to  ensure the financial details of customers and beneficiaries are kept secure.<br />
                                      A requirement was  there for made that the Financial Database should have its password changed  every 6 weeks. This would also affect all connecting applications. <br />
                                      Initially the process  would require an extended outage of all the financial systems.<br />
                                      I wrote bash scripts  that would push out the new password to any relating applications and scripts  via a text file.</p>
                                    <p>I also created a  procedure to ensure this was as efficient as possible enabling anyone with the  relevant level of access to complete.</p>
                                    <p>By implementing my  changes the outage was reduced from 24 hours to just 2 hours, which in turn  created greater financial benefits to the company.</p>

                                      <strong>1E:  Test Analyst</strong><br />
                                      1E are a &lsquo;Green&rsquo;  software company, producing software that aids companies to help reduce their  footprint by ensuring servers use minimal power, and then increased power when  required. Their software also reports all information relevant to the  infrastructure.<br />
                                      Upon arrival it was  clear that the software worked solely for Microsoft Servers.<br />
                                      And that a new  requirement was made for this to work on all operating systems.</p>
                                    <p>I produced a single  bash script which checked the O/S (Linux or Unix), and what type/version. It  then collected all the relevant information according to the O/S, such as CPU  and Memory Usage etc enabling the software to work. <br />
                                      The company could  then offer the software for all operating systems to both existing and new  customers.</p>

                                      <strong>GE  Aviation: Project Manager</strong><br />
                                      There was a  requirement to provide validation of software licences installed on the test  infrastructure.<br />
                                      Appointed as the  Software Project Manager, my task was to find a method to retrieve a list of  installed software from every Test Rig, this ranged from the very old Dos 3.0  servers to the latest Microsoft 2008 Servers, as well as some Linux and Unix  servers.</p>
                                    <p>I produced a script  to run on all variants of Microsoft operating systems to provide a listing to  import into a new MS SQL database, this database was then compared to the  Purchase order database for the relevant licenses, &nbsp;<br />
                                  With this information  we were able to show the shortfall to be in the region of &pound;425,000, which  enabled the company to prevent any future fines. </p></td>
