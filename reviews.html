                                      I was very confident having Ken work directly on client projects, and he always received<br>
                                      brilliant feedback from the clients.<br>

                                    <p>&ldquo;I worked with Ken on a very challenging Accenture led project for a global technology client.<br/>
                                      We had to deliver a managed Linux Ubuntu build to new laptop hardware.<br/>
                                      I was the build lead on the project. We had already been through a few consultants that could not deliver what was required and then Ken came in and saved the day.<br/>
                                      He delivered an automated/scripted build and worked out all the hardware/OS issues we had been having for months.<br/>
                                      He was very good with the end users and managed all device handouts himself 1 on 1.<br/>
                                      Some users had been particularly demanding throughout the project, but he managed them well and showed great patience.<br/>
                                      He also fully documented the entire build and carried out training/handover sessions with BAU teams.<br/> 
                                      He was fantastic. The client was extremely happy with him.<br/>
                                      We would never have delivered the project requirements without him.&rdquo;<br/>

                                      I found Ken to be friendly, approachable professional and extremely knowledgable and dedicated to the task at hand and overall project,
                                      Ken is a great asset to any team or organisation.&rdquo;<br/>

His attention to detail is impressive. He performed as a liaison among the clients, business managers, the program manager, software development and QA staff coordinating the tests and implementation of complex, highly visible, and demanding migration projects. His clear, detailed and comprehensive documentation of the test plan made it very easy to for the testers to test and sign off.
