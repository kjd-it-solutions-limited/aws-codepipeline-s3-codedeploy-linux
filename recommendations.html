                                    <p>&ldquo;Ken worked at TIBCO for 6 months as a senior information  systems analyst. During this period Ken proved to be a most capable individual  in terms of his technical ability and made great in roads into improving  TIBCO's IT infrastructure. Ken was also a very willing team player and was  always very professional in his dealings with colleagues and customers alike.  He has been a real pleasure to work with and will be greatly missed at TIBCO&rdquo;. <br />

                                      I&rsquo;ve always found  you friendly and easy to work with, and that you have always treated me with  courtesy and politeness.&rdquo; <br />

I was  really impressed with the dedication he has shown to setup all these servers as  required and documented them accordingly to help others. <br />

During his time at TS Tech UK Ken  demonstrated a high level of skill and produced many scripts and procedures to  make life easier for the rest of the department. Ken also took the time to  write detailed documentation of the implementation of the QAD systems and the  processes that each department in the business would use so that the IT  department could resolve any issue with ease and without delay&rdquo;.<br />
